# kungalv_house_prices
This project involves practicing key data science skills by extracting and analyzing real-world housing data. 
In the first part, Python and Beautiful Soup IS USED to parse HTML files containing property sale listings
 from Hemnet, extracting structured information such as sale date, address, area, number of rooms, plot size, 
and final sale price. The cleaned data is then saved as a CSV file. In the second part, the focus is on analyzing
 house sales from 2022, producing visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots to explore trends and 
relationships between variables like house area and price.
